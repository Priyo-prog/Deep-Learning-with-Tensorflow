        "\n",
        "Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pre-Training**\n",
        "When we train the network on a large dataset(for example: ImageNet) , we train all the parameters of the neural network and therefore the model is learned. It may take hours on your GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fine Tuning**\n",
        "We can give the new dataset to fine tune the pre-trained CNN. Consider that the new dataset is almost similar to the orginal dataset used for pre-training. Since the new dataset is similar, the same weights can be used for extracting the features from the new dataset.\n",
        "If the new dataset is very small, it’s better to train only the final layers of the network to avoid overfitting, keeping all other layers fixed. So remove the final layers of the pre-trained network. Add new layers . Retrain only the new layers.\n",
        "If the new dataset is very much large, retrain the whole network with initial weights from the pretrained model. \n",
